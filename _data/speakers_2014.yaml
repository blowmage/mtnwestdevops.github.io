  title: "Modern DevOps: Understanding the Terrain"
  description: |-
    In 2013, we saw the introduction of many new DevOps tools and existing tools such as Vagrant saw some huge improvements and features added. With all this change, its hard to keep up with not only what has changed, but how to use these changes and what benefits they have.

    This talk begins by briefly introducing a handful of my own tools: Vagrant, Packer, and Serf. I talk about what their purpose is, some of their latest features, and who is using these tools. I then continue to show how these tools can be used along with other software such as Docker to create some truly amazing development and production stacks. For production stacks, I discuss the benefits of using some of these tools over existing options, and for development stacks, I show how Vagrant improves process and workflow to help streamline the entire process from development through to production.

  title: Automating cloud factories and the internet assembly line with SaltStack
  description: |-
    SaltStack does a lot of stuff, mostly focusing on infrastructure automation, configuration management and cloud orchestration. Quite simply, our software helps automate DevOps tasks for speed and scale on the Internet assembly line. But there's much more, so Tom will provide a quick overview of the SaltStack platform and share a few things you probably don't know about how SaltStack is used in DevOps organizations today. Tom's talk will highlight the need for speed and scale in DevOps, put an end to an age-old holy war in configuration management, talk about why we need more lightweight cloud control, outline the benefits of automation glue for all the infrastructure things, and show how test automation can be easier and faster combining Salt, Jenkins, Docker and Git.
  biography: Thomas Hatch, founder and CTO of SaltStack, is the benevolent dictator of Salt, one of the largest open source projects in the world and fast becoming the largest Python code base ever.

  title: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love DevOps
  description: |-
    I was a college-student BOFH, an ISP sysadmin, and an academic IT manager. If I wanted a curmudgeonly sysadmin, I could just look in a mirror. Most developers were unlikely to be granted root on any systems whatsoever, and servers were carefully hand-whittled works of art. You know, The Way Things Were.

    Moving to a role doing operations at a developer-centric startup was both a culture shock and a great learning experience. I'll discuss what worked for me (and what was challenging!) in terms of my transition to a DevOps practice. Spoiler alert: change is scary, but awesome developers on the team make it much easier for an old-school sysadmin to be assimilated into the DevOps of Borg.
  biography: 'Bridget Kromhout does operations at a Minneapolis social commerce startup
    called 8thBridge, after years as a sysadmin at ISPs and in academia. Favorite
    AWS service: ElasticMapReduce. OS on home servers: FreeBSD. Config management
    tool of choice: Chef. Words written for SysAdvent about HBase on EMR: ~4200. Current
    object of obsession: monitoring all the things with Graphite.'

  title: What your Mother never told you about Automating Security
  description: 'Your mother might be cooler than mine, but security is hard work.
    Heavily automated environments like "the cloud" bring both new strategies and
    new challenges. We''ll work through some real-life problems and solutions; topics
    maybe your mom forgot to mention. Off-topic topics will include: controlling and
    tracking network access; 2-factor authentication and you; security-minded logging
    and metrics, and the importance of using protection for data at rest. There will
    be code.'

  title: '"DevOps" in a Post-DevOps World'
  description: |-
    Has "DevOps" jumped the shark?

    Some say yes; others say 2014 will be the year DevOps dons its Fonz-esque leather jacket. Whichever you believe, the marketing feeding frenzy has begun and the dilution of the "DevOps" concept to include everything (and simultaneously mean nothing) is palpable.

    But DevOps has a dirty secret: many of its core tenets are ancient computer history: configuration management, version control, automated builds, and metrics-driven decision making: all old news. So what caused these long-known best practices to congeal and pop together, becoming part of the industry consciousness? And why have some been so successful at implementing it in their organizations while others continue to struggle?

    This talk deconstructs the meta-elements of DevOps that made it resonate so strongly with so many and allowed those familiar DevOps poster children&mdash;Netflix, Etsy, and others&mdash;to deploy the methodology with such success in their businesses. We'll go beyond DevOps' classical CAMS (culture, automation, metrics, and sharing) definition to discover what exactly what made DevOps relevant, and what about it is so timeless and foundational that it will make whatever-follows-DevOps relevant, too.
  biography: J. Paul Reed has over a decade of experience in the trenches as a build/release
    and tools engineer, working with such organizations as VMware, Mozilla, and Symantec.
    In 2012, he founded Release Engineering Approaches, a consultancy incorporating

  title: Introduction to Docker
  description: "Docker is an open source LXC-based container service that was released
    in March 2013. It makes it easy to create lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient
    containers. Containers which you can use to test applications, build and run services
    or even to build your own platform-as-a-service. Learn why Docker matters, how
    to get started with it and see some cool examples of Docker in action. This talk
    will explain: \n\n* Why Docker?\n* Installing Docker\n* Getting started with Docker\n*
    Demo some cool Docker use cases\n\nIt'll also discuss the right places to use
    Docker and try to answer some of the questions around using Docker with other
    tools like Puppet and Chef. By the end of the talk you'll see both how Docker
    is useful and how to make use of it."

  title: Bridging the DevOps Islands with Pantry
  description: DevOps is a fascinating, quickly growing field. With Chef, Puppet,
    Ansible, Salt, Packer, Docker, Vagrant, AWS, and others, there are many ways to
    get an infrastructure up and running. However, it is quickly evident to those
    entering this field that choosing one tool often excludes all others or requires
    significant investment in custom development to fit the chosen tool(s) into the
    intended infrastructure. In this talk I'll be introducing Pantry, a tool-agnostic
    provisioning service we've been building and running at Collective Idea. Pantry's
    job is to facilitate communication between developers and their infrastructure,
    ease the burden on setting up new infrastructure, and to allow seamless use of
    multiple DevOps tools together. I will be talking about how Pantry came to be,
    the ideas and technology it uses, the problems Pantry solves for us at Collective
    Idea and what the future will bring.
  biography: A Ruby developer for seven-plus years, Jason has also been an operations

  title: I Serve No Master!
  description: Typical Puppet users implement this tool in its traditional role of
    client and master. At Adaptive Computing we build environments for developers all
    day long using OpenStack, as such the traditional model of client to server for
    Puppet just didn't fit. For the longest time I thought I was doing it wrong,
    however Puppet can be implemented without the need of a puppetmaster. The
    presentation will focus on utilizing puppet in a masterless state allowing the
    rapid configuration for your environment with no need for the cruft of managing a
    traditional puppet master. There are pros and cons that will be explored as well
    as detailed examples of how Adaptive took environment installs from hours of
    developers time down to about 10 minutes.
  biography: All the cool kids talk about Puppet in client server models. Some release
    cycles and environments are not traditional DevOps setups, I don't deploy 100
    times a day, but that doesn't mean DevOps or the tools used to implement DevOps
    are dead to the 'rest' of us. The release cycle I take part in is just over 6
    months long, yes really. The dev's I help traditionally spent days of time standing
    up our stack for dev work, once I introduced Puppet and overcame the my masterless
    phobia my dev's can stand up their test env's in minutes. This then spills over
    to QA, Sales, and Professional Services. There is value in understanding the role
    of Puppet in a masterless setup, it might just win you over!

  title: The Immutable Pipeline
  description: |-
    Over the last couple years we've gotten better tooling for building consistent servers. With the introduction of Packer this last year, it's become easier to automate the process of building consistent images. Thinking of images as compiled (immutable), configurable, runnable, containers opens up some interesting possibilities.

    In this talk I'll be introducing the Immutable Pipeline, a process our team uses to ensure consistency between staging and production. I will also be covering ways we test our images before they move to production.
